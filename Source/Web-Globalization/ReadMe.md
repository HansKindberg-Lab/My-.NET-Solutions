# ASP.NET Core application with request-culture-providers

This is a globalized ASP.NET Core application, not a localized one. There are no resource-files for translations. It's an application to show how to select the desired culture/ui-culture.

- [Globalization and localization in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization/)

The supported cultures are configurable in [AppSettings.json](/Source/Web-Globalization/NET-Core-MVC/AppSettings.json).
